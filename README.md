# AI-Driven Stock Trading Using Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates an AI-based stock trading system using Reinforcement Learning. The goal is to optimize stock trading decisions (buy, sell, hold) based on historical data.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main Jupyter Notebook (`RL_stock_price.ipynb`).
- `examples/`: (optional) Example datasets or sample runs.
- `docs/`: (optional) Any additional project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aayush-Rajput03/AIBF-rl-stocktrading.git


Open the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook src/RL_stock_price.ipynb
